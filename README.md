# Renewable Energy Management System

## Introduction

Energy is the backbone of complete production activity; no productive activity can function without energy because it is an important aspect of the development process. It offers faster life for everyone, which means faster transportation, a speedy manufacturing process for industries, and faster communication. However, despite its importance, the possibility of energy destroying the world would be great if we did not know how to produce it.

Most factories and homes use fossil fuels to obtain energy, which leads to many environmental problems. Energy and environmental problems are closely linked, as it is almost impossible to produce, transport, or consume energy without a significant environmental impact. Environmental problems directly related to energy production and consumption include air pollution, climate change, water pollution, thermal pollution, and solid waste disposal. The emission of air pollutants from fossil fuel combustion is the main cause of air pollution in urban areas. The burning of fossil fuels is also a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions.

To mitigate these environmental issues, there are multiple types of clean energy to be harnessed, such as solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, and hydropower. However, the successful integration of renewable energy (RE) into the grid poses several challenges. One such challenge is ensuring high energy conversion efficiency, which depends on various factors and nonlinear interactions between parameters.

Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are becoming increasingly popular as an alternative approach to traditional technologies in solving problems related to renewable energy systems. AI can help in availability prediction, forecasting, and control of renewable energy systems, improving their performance and efficiency.

Another crucial factor affecting renewable energy production is weather dependency. Despite effective weather forecasting technologies, sudden climate changes can impact the flow of energy. Hence, the growing demand for renewable energy emphasizes the need to invest in machine learning and other emerging technologies for data-driven decision-making.
